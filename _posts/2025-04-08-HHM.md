Have you thought why there's an Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in either the northern or southern hemisphere?  
It's an adjustment due to **asymmetric heating**!

But before we dive into that, let‚Äôs start from a simpler case.

## Symmetric Heating

Due to the meridional gradient in incoming solar radiation, the tropics receive more energy than they emit, while the high latitudes lose more energy than they gain. This imbalance creates a temperature gradient, often referred to as $$\theta_E$$, which drives the need for poleward energy transport ($$\theta_M$$) to restore equilibrium.

When the heating is symmetric about the equator, the Hadley circulation spans both hemispheres symmetrically.

The **Held‚ÄìHou model** provides a conceptual framework to explain this circulation. It assumes angular momentum conservation in the upper branch of the Hadley cell and applies thermal wind balance to determine the latitudinal extent and strength of the circulation.

Key ideas:
- Equatorial air rises due to strong heating.
- Air moves poleward aloft, conserving angular momentum.
- Subsidence occurs in the subtropics, forming a symmetric Hadley cell.

## Asymmetric Heating

Now let‚Äôs imagine the Northern Hemisphere is warmer than the Southern Hemisphere.

What happens?
- The Hadley cell shifts.
- The ITCZ moves toward the warmer hemisphere.
- Subtropical jets become asymmetric.

  <img src="/images/post/fig_hw2a_8.png" width="32%" />
  <img src="/images/post/fig_hw2a_10.png" width="32%" />
</div>

This asymmetry is key to understanding seasonal shifts of the ITCZ and long-term changes in tropical rainfall patterns.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Derivation

The Held-Hou model assumes an inviscid, axisymmetric, steady-state circulation under hydrostatic and geostrophic balance.  
Let‚Äôs derive the angular momentum constraint and temperature structure.

**1. Angular momentum conservation (above the boundary layer):**


$${ 
M = (a \cos\phi)^2 \Omega + a \cos\phi \, u = \text{const}
}$$

Assume air initially at rest (ùë¢=0,u=0) at the equator moves to latitude ùúô conserving angular momentum:
$${
u = a \Omega \left( \frac{\cos^2\phi_0 - \cos^2\phi}{\cos\phi} \right) 
}$$

Under small-angle approximation (ùúô‚âà0):
$${ 
u \approx a \Omega (\phi_0^2 - \phi^2) 
}$$

where:
- \( M \): absolute angular momentum
- \( a \): Earth radius
- $$( \phi )$$: latitude
- \( \Omega \): Earth's rotation rate
- \( u \): zonal wind

**2. Thermal wind balance (in log-pressure coordinates):**

Start from the thermal wind balance in the zonal-mean, axisymmetric atmosphere:
$${
f \frac{\partial u}{\partial \ln p} = \frac{R}{a} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \phi} 
}$$

Assuming constant stratification and integrating with respect to height gives:
$${
u(\phi) = \frac{g H}{a f} \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \phi}
}$$

Using continuity at boundaries and symmetry arguments, you derive:
$${
\Delta M = M(\phi) - M(\phi_1) = -2 \Omega a^2 (\phi^2 - \phi_1^2)
}$$
This provides a constraint for determining the Hadley cell extent.


1. $$\int_{Y-}^{Y1} (\theta_E - \theta_M) \, dy = 0$$

2. $$\int_{Y1}^{Y+} (\theta_E - \theta_M) \, dy = 0$$

3. Continuity at \(y = Y+\) and \(y = Y-\)
