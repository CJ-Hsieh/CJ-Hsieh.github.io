Have you thought why there's an Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in either the northern or southern hemisphere?  
It's an adjustment due to **asymmetric heating**!

But before we dive into that, let‚Äôs start from a simpler case.

## Symmetric Heating

When heating is symmetric around the equator, the Hadley circulation spans both hemispheres symmetrically.  
The **Held-Hou model** is a simple conceptual framework that explains this using angular momentum conservation and thermal wind balance.

</div>

Key ideas:
- Equatorial air rises due to strong heating.
- Air moves poleward aloft, conserving angular momentum.
- Subsidence occurs in the subtropics, forming a symmetric Hadley cell.

## Asymmetric Heating

Now let‚Äôs imagine the Northern Hemisphere is warmer than the Southern Hemisphere.

What happens?
- The Hadley cell shifts.
- The ITCZ moves toward the warmer hemisphere.
- Subtropical jets become asymmetric.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px;">

  <img src="/images/post/fig_hw2a_2.png" width="32%" />
  <img src="/images/post/fig_hw2a_4.png" width="32%" />
  <img src="/images/post/fig_hw2a_6.png" width="32%" />
  <img src="/images/post/fig_hw2a_8.png" width="32%" />
  <img src="/images/post/fig_hw2a_10.png" width="32%" />
</div>

This asymmetry is key to understanding seasonal shifts of the ITCZ and long-term changes in tropical rainfall patterns.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Derivation

The Held-Hou model assumes an inviscid, axisymmetric, steady-state circulation under hydrostatic and geostrophic balance.  
Let‚Äôs derive the angular momentum constraint and temperature structure.

**1. Angular momentum conservation (above the boundary layer):**

$$
\[
M = (a \cos\phi)^2 \Omega + a \cos\phi \, u = \text{const}
\]
$$

where:
- \( M \): absolute angular momentum
- \( a \): Earth radius
- \( \phi \): latitude
- \( \Omega \): Earth's rotation rate
- \( u \): zonal wind

**2. Thermal wind balance (in log-pressure coordinates):**

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \ln p} = \frac{R}{f} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}
\]


1. $$
    \int_{Y-}^{Y1} (\theta_E - \theta_M) \, dy = 0
   $$

3. $$ \(\int_{Y1}^{Y+} (\theta_E - \theta_M) \, dy = 0\\) 

4. Continuity of  \(\theta\)  at \(y = Y+\) and \(y = Y-\)
Combined with the assumption of radiative equilibrium outside the tropics, we can solve for the latitude extent of the Hadley cell.
